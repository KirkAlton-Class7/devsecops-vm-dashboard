# Features and Roadmap


## DevSecOps Mode

**DevSecOps Mode (default view)** – A real-time, graphical dashboard of infrastructure health. Optimized for live system metrics and quick access to VM information.
To enable, press `D` or click the **DevSecOps** button in the mode dropdown menu.

---

### Summary Cards

* Four interactive summary cards:

  * **CPU Usage** – current percentage with color-coded health status
  * **Memory Usage** – real-time memory consumption
  * **Disk Usage** – root partition utilization
  * **Estimated Cost** – heuristic, cloud-specific running cost (approximate)

* Each card updates every **10 seconds** via the live API.

* **Cards are clickable:**

  * **CPU / Memory / Disk** → GCP Compute Engine instance details page
  * **Estimated Cost** → GCP Billing overview

---

### Load

* **System Load (1m)** – current load average

* **Trend Chart** – bar graph of the last 10 samples (10s interval)

* **Detailed insights:**

  * Peak load (last 10 readings)
  * Average load
  * Color-coded status: Normal / Elevated / High / Critical

* Chart auto-rescales to peak load (capped at 5.0)

---

### VM Information

Grouped into three compact cards:

* **Identity**

  * Project ID
  * Instance ID
  * Instance Name
  * Hostname
  * Machine Type

* **Network**

  * VPC
  * Subnet
  * Internal IP
  * External IP

* **Location**

  * Region
  * Zone
  * Uptime (human-readable)
  * Load average (5m)

> All fields are fetched from the cloud metadata service (with fallbacks) and update live.

---

### System Resources

A detailed widget with three sections:

* **CPU**

  * Current usage (percentage bar)
  * Core count + frequency (if available)
  * **Live CPU Trend** – mini line chart (last 20 readings, 10s interval)

* **Memory**

  * Total / Used / Free (MB or GB)
  * Usage bar

* **Disk**

  * Total / Used / Available (MB or GB)
  * Usage bar

---

### Services

Displays health and status of key system components returned by `build_dashboard_data()`:

* **nginx** – running / stopped

* **Python** – installed

* **Metadata Service** – reachable

* **HTTP Service** – serving

* **Startup Script** – completed

* **GitHub Quotes Sync** – successful

* **Bootstrap Packages** – installed packages list

* **Default view** – shows 10 services by default and displays `Showing X of X services`

* **View all services** – opens the full service list in a modal

* **Sort services** – cycles through Name A-Z, Name Z-A, Status Healthy-Critical, and Status Critical-Healthy

* **Filter services** – filters by service name and status

---

### Application Logs

* Displays the last **30** log entries from `journalctl`

Each entry includes:

* Time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)

* Level (info / warning / error)

* Scope/source (from `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER`, truncated for display)

* Message

* **View all logs** – opens a modal backed by `/api/logs`

* **Show older logs** – appends paginated logs using the same timestamp format, including year

* **Refresh logs** – reloads the currently selected time window

* **Sort logs** – cycles through Time Newest, Time Oldest, Level Error-Debug, Level Debug-Error, Source A-Z, and Source Z-A

* **Filter logs** – filters the currently loaded logs by level and source

* **Search logs** – searches loaded modal rows by time, level, source, or message

> Filters are client-side and apply to the logs currently loaded in the modal. They persist while paging older logs and reset on full refresh.
> When a filter modal is opened from another modal, closing it restores focus to the previous modal layer.

---

### Mock / Fallback Data Warning

When any visible dashboard section is using bundled mock data or API fallback data, the header shows a red **Mock Data Active** diagnostic pill beside the date/time controls.

Clicking the pill opens a diagnostic panel that lists the affected sections and remediation guidance, including deployment configuration, API/service health, environment variables, and restart/redeploy steps.

The warning hides automatically after the relevant live API responds successfully.

---

## Text Mode

A minimalist, terminal-style view of DevSecOps data. Optimized for keyboard navigation and copy-paste workflows.

To enable, press `T` or click **TEXT MODE** (top-right).

Displays:

* Identity, Overview, Network, Location
* Monitoring endpoints
* Services with the same 10-row default, sort, filter, and view-all behavior as DevSecOps mode
* Application logs with Time, Level, Source, and Message columns
* `[WARNING]` in the top controls when mock or fallback data diagnostics are active

Exit with `Esc` or `[Esc] EXIT`.

---

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key   | Action                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Esc` | Exit text mode                             |
| `C`   | Copy dashboard snapshot                    |
| `H`   | Toggle help overlay                        |
| `L`   | Sort logs                                  |
| `FL`  | Filter logs                                |

| `SS`  | View all services                          |

Text mode filter popups use the same filter options as the graphical dashboard:

* Arrow keys move through filter columns
* `Space` or `Enter` toggles a filter
* `Delete` or `Backspace` clears filters
* `Esc` closes the active popup and returns focus to the previous modal layer

Text mode log sorting cycles through Time Newest, Time Oldest, Level Error-Debug, and Level Debug-Error.

When `ALL SYSTEM LOGS` is open, press `R` to refresh the loaded log window.

> [!TIP]
> Favorite quotes are saved in `localStorage` and persist across sessions.

## FinOps Mode

**FinOps Mode** – A cost-optimization dashboard for cloud spend, budgets, and usage.
To enable, press `F` or click the **FinOps** button.

---

### Core Widgets

* **Total Cost (MTD)** – month-to-date spend (BigQuery)

* **Forecast (EOM)** – projected end-of-month cost

* **Potential Savings** – estimated savings from rightsizing

* **CUD Coverage** – placeholder (coming soon)

* **FinOps summary cards are clickable:**

  * **Total Cost / Forecast** → GCP Billing overview
  * **Potential Savings** → FinOps Hub
  * **CUD Coverage** → Compute Engine commitments

* **Daily Cost Trend** – last 10 days

* **Top Services by Cost** – spend breakdown

* **Budgets** – configured budgets with placeholder spent/forecast values

* **CPU Utilization** – P95 per VM (last hour), 10-row preview with sort/view-all modal

* **Rightsizing Recommendations** – machine recommendations, 10-row preview with sort/view-all modal

* **Idle Resources** – underutilized assets, 10-row preview with sort/view-all modal

* **Filtering and search** – FinOps list widgets use modal-based filters and modal search. CPU filters include rightsizing candidate and utilization range. Idle resource filters include scope, status, and resource type. Rightsizing filters include level and savings.

* **Savings Summary** – realized savings (`0.0`) + potential rightsizing savings

* **Mock / fallback warning** – if `/api/finops` fails and the UI falls back to bundled FinOps data, the header diagnostic pill lists the affected FinOps sections.

> **Note:** Data is sourced from GCP APIs (BigQuery, Monitoring, Recommender, Budgets).
> Initial data population may be delayed (see below).

---

## Endpoints (Quick Reference)

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| `/healthz`       | GET    | Returns `ok` (NGINX check) |
| `/metadata`      | GET    | VM + health JSON           |
| `/api/dashboard` | GET    | DevSecOps data             |
| `/api/finops`    | GET    | FinOps data                |
| `/api/config`    | GET    | API config JSON            |
| `/api/logs`      | GET    | Paginated journal logs     |

---

### Example `/metadata` Response (GCP)

*(unchanged)*

---

## Known Limitation — Clipboard (HTTP vs HTTPS)

Clipboard API requires secure context.

**Works only on:**

* `https://`
* `http://localhost`

**Fails on:**

* `http://<public-ip>`

---

### Impact

* Text Mode → Copy (`C`) unreliable on HTTP
* Dashboard copy buttons may also fail outside secure browser contexts
* Dashboard otherwise unaffected

When the browser rejects a copy action, the UI shows a centered red toast: `Clipboard unavailable on public HTTP. Try HTTPS, SSH tunnel, or manual copy.`

---

### Fix

Serve via **HTTPS** (NGINX + Certbot)

---

### Workaround

Fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')` (deprecated, requires interaction)

---

## Roadmap & Upcoming Features

### Security

* [ ] Enable HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt + NGINX)
* [ ] Self-signed cert mode for labs

### FinOps

* [ ] CUD coverage widget
* [ ] Forecast vs Budget sparklines
